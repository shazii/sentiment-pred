IDEAS for Part5

1. Do BIO name entity recognition first and assign “neutral” sentiment to all entities
	should be a good baseline, at least better than HMM-viterbi

2. from simple observation, our model may not make sense because the sentiment of a NE is often determined by some other words in the sentence. For example, negative: died, bad… positive: favourite, best, love. Maybe we can do

Part 5 improvement log

1. Core idea: separate prediction of NER (BIO) and sentiment, as sentiment of NE is often determined by the sentence/its context
2. Methods to improve NER:
    2.1 Emission parameter for observations that did not appear with all states in the train set: e_param[i][obs] = 0.01 / max(count) //Improvement: +2%
    2.2 Lowercase all words //Improvement: +3%
    2.3 Normalize all web links to "http://" //Improvement: +1%

3. Methods to improve Sentiment Prediction
    3.1 TODO:Yujia's method
    3.2 effective polar words with counts
